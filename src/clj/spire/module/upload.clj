(defmacro upload
  "transfer files and directories from the local client to the remote
  machines.
  (upload options)

  given:

  `options`: A hashmap of options

  `:src` A path to a file or directory on the local machine

  `:content` Alternatively specify content to upload. Can be a string,
  a `java.io.File` instance or a `byte-array`

  `:dest` A remote path to copy the files into

  `:recurse` If the local path is a directory, recurse through all
  the file and directories

  `:preserve` Preserve the local files' modification flags when
  copying them to the remote filesystem

  `:dir-mode` If `:preserve` is `false`, this specifies the modification
  parameters created directories will have.

  `:mode` If `:preserve` is `false`, this specifies the modification
  parameters of copied files.

  `:owner` If specified the local files and directories will be owned
  by this user.

  `:group` If specified the local files and directories will be owned
  by this group.

  `:force` Force the copy operation to overwrite incompatible
  content. Such as a file upload overwriting a directory or a
  directory copy overwriting a file.

  `:attrs` Set the file or files special attributes. Provided as a
  string that is accepted to the chattr shell command.
