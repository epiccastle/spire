  `options`: A hashmap of options, where:

  `:path` The path to a file

  `:regexp` The regular expression to look for in every line of the
  file. The line that matches will be replaced.

  `:string-match` A string to look for in every line of the file. The
  line that contains a match for the string will be replaced.

  `:line-match` An entire line to look for in every line of the
  file. The line that completely matches the string will be
  replaced. If neither `:regexp` nor `:string-match` nor `:line-match`
  is specified, then the contents of `:line` is used as a value for
  `:line-match`.

  `:line-num` Specify the line to match by line number instead of
  regular expression.

  `:line` The contents of the line to insert into the file.

  `:after` A regular expression to insert the line after, if the
  `:regexp` match is not found.

  `:before` A regular expression to insert the line before, if the
  `:regexp` match is not found.

  `:match` How to handle files with multiple lines that match. Should
  be `:first`, `:last` or `:all`

  `:insert-at` If no line matches and no `:after` or `:before`
  matches, where to insert the line. Should be `:eof` for end of file,
  or `:bof` for beginning of file.
