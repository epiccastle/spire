  given:

  `options`: a hashmap of options, where:

  `:cmd` the command string to execute.

  `:shell` the shell to use to run the command. The default is `bash`

  `:dir` the working directory to run the command within. If a
  relative path, is relative to the users home directory when running
  on a remote system, and relative to the execution that was the
  current working directory when spire was executed.

  `:stdin` supply a string argument to pass to the executing script as
  its standard input

  `:env` a hashmap of environment variables to set before executing
  the command. Environment variable names (the hashmap keys) can be
  keywords or strings.

  `:out` the encoding of the commands output. Default is \"UTF-8\"

  `:creates` a list of filenames that the command will create. If
  these files exist on the machine, the command will not be executed
  and the job result will be reported as `:ok`

  `:ok-exit` a callable that will be passed the shell exit code. If
  it returns true, the job is marked as `:result :ok`

  `:changed-exit` a callable that will be passed the shell exit
  code. If it returns true the job is marked as
  `:result :changed`. Note: :changed-exit is checked
  after :ok-exit. If both return false, the job is marked as
  `:result :failed`.
