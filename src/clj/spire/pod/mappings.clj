;; A two-way, auto collecting, weakref object instance mapping system

;; All the spire java instances need to stay in the spire heap memory.
;; On the babashka side, we need to refer to these objects with keywords.
;; We need to look up an instance from a keyword, and a keyword from
;; an instance. If we stored these in a normal hashmap, we would
;; hold references to these instances and prevent garbage collection. Thus
;; we need to use weak references and create both lookups so what when
;; the garbage collector deletes the instance, the references are
;; removed from the mapping structure automatically.
